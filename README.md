# InternshipProject

To run, I used XAMMP. I first created a database with the weather table and its columns information as shown in the db.sql file. Then, ran it on the browser using the following URL:http://localhost/InternshipProject/index.html.

Some details I have on the app is that you can enter any form of location (city, postal code, town,...). I also did the CRUD assesment.
